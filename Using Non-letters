Using non-letters

If you want to use non-letters in the class (or enum...) display, you can either :
Use the as keyword in the class definition
Put quotes "" around the class name
@startuml
class "This is my class" as class1
class class2 as "It works this way too"

class2 *-- "foo/dummy" : use
@enduml

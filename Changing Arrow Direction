Changing arrows direction

By default, links between classes have two dashes -- and are vertically oriented. It is possible to use horizontal link by putting a single dash (or dot) like this:
@startuml
Room o- Student
Room *-- Chair
@enduml
controlling arrows direction
You can also change directions by reversing the link:
@startuml
Student -o Room
Chair --* Room
@enduml
changing arrows direction
It is also possible to change arrow direction by adding left, right, up or down keywords inside the arrow:
@startuml
foo -left-> dummyLeft 
foo -right-> dummyRight 
foo -up-> dummyUp 
foo -down-> dummyDown
@enduml
left right up and down example
You can shorten the arrow by using only the first character of the direction (for example, -d- instead of -down-) or the two first characters (-do-).
Please note that you should not abuse this functionality : Graphviz gives usually good results without tweaking.

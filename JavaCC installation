The download should have placed into your file system either a zip or gzip file containing the JavaCC software.

To install, open a command line, go to the directory where the file was installed, and depending on which file you downloaded either type:

unzip javacc-6.0.zip 

for zip files, or:

gunzip javacc-6.0.tar.gz 

followed by

tar xvf javacc-6.0.tar 

for gzip files.

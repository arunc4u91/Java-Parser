PlantUML in a nutshell
  PlantUML is used to draw UML diagram, using a simple and human readable text description. 
  Be carefull, because it does not prevent you from drawing inconsistent diagram (like having two classes inheriting from each other, for example). 
  So it's more a drawing tool than a modeling tool.

PlantUML is a component that allows to quickly write :
  Sequence diagram
  Usecase diagram
  Class diagram
  Activity diagram (here is the legacy syntax),
  Component diagram
  State diagram
  Object diagram
  Deployment diagram 
  Timing diagram 
The following non-UML diagrams are also supported:
  Wireframe graphical interface
  Archimate diagram
  Specification and Description Language (SDL)
  Ditaa diagram
  Gantt diagram 
  Mathematic with AsciiMath or JLaTeXMath notation
Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language.

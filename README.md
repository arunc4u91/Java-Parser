Initially We have to parse the Java Program and find Classes, constructors, Attributes.

Use that to generate UML diagrams.

Java Compiler Compiler™ (JavaCC™) is the most popular parser generator for use with Java™ applications. A parser generator is a tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java program that can recognize matches to the grammar. In addition to the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities related to parser generation such as tree building (via a tool called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions, debugging, etc.


Latest version of Java parser - 0.6.-10

I am trying to create a Intermittent file between Java parser and PlantUML. This file will be the output of java parser and input to Plant uml.

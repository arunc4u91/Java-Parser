Association classes

You can define association class after that a relation has been defined between two classes, like in this example:
@startuml
class Student {
  Name
}
Student "0..*" - "1..*" Course
(Student, Course) .. Enrollment

class Enrollment {
  drop()
  cancel()
}
@enduml
association classes
You can define it in another direction:
@startuml
class Student {
  Name
}
Student "0..*" -- "1..*" Course
(Student, Course) . Enrollment

class Enrollment {
  drop()
  cancel()
}
@enduml
association classes
